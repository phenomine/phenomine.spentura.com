# The Phenomine Framework

Phenomine is a modern PHP web framework that makes it easy to build web applications. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing you to get started quickly and build powerful applications with minimal effort.
Phenomine is built on top of the latest PHP features and best practices, making it a great choice for developers who want to build modern web applications.

You can build dynamic web applications or "SPAs" (Single Page Applications) with minimal JavaScript, allowing you to create fast and responsive web applications with minimal effort. This is a modern approach to building web applications that allows you to update parts of the page without reloading the entire page.

You don't need a front-end framework to build a modern web application. Phenomine is a full-stack framework that provides everything you need to build web applications, including routing, middleware, controllers, views, models, and more. It is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you to customize and extend the framework to suit your needs.

## Architectural Patterns
Phenomine is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. MVC separates application into three components - Model, View and Controller. The Model represents the data, the view represents the output representation of the data, and the controller controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes.
